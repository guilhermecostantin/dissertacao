	Our model allows deviations on both sides of the estimated frontier

	effects such as measurement errors. The model is then estimated using
	an empirical dataset of 65 software maintenance projects from a large
	commercial bank. The insights obtained from the estimation results
	are found to be quite consistent for reasonable variations in the

  volume = {4},

  series = {Information science and statistics},
  abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
	over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments
	in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian
	methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,
	while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing
	and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
	of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development
	of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational
	Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels
	have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
	This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
	providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
	and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
	PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
	knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is
	assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear
	algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
	would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
	introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
	courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
	processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive
	support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
	exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for
	a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while
	solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
	publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,
	and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
	information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical
	aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include
	free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example
	data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant
	Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair
	in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow
	of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the
	Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
	Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

	example, developing algorithmic models requires extensive past project

	based on experienced estimators depend on estimators' availability
	and are not easily repeatable, as well as not being much more accurate
	than algorithmic techniques. We present a method for cost estimation
	that combines aspects of algorithmic and experiential approaches
	(referred to as COBRA, COst estimation, Benchmarking, and Risk Assessment).
	We find through a case study that cost estimates using COBRA show
	an average ARE of 0.09. Although we do not have the room to describe
	the benchmarking and risk assessment parts, the reader will find
	detailed information in (Briand et al., 1997)},

	does not fully value intangibles, even when independently verified

  abstract = {Noch immer gelingt es einem Gro\{\ss\}teil der Software-Entwicklungsprojekte
	nicht, die geforderten Funktionalit\{\"{a}\}ten in der vorgegeben
	Zeit mit den geplanten Ressourcen umzusetzen. In den letzten Jahren
	entstanden in vielen Bereichen des Projektmanagements immer mehr
	Methoden und Entwicklungsphilosophien, welche einen "Pool" von "Best
	Practices" verwenden. Dieser Methodenpool sollte den Projektmanagern
	die Arbeit erleichtern und die Erfolgsquote der Projekte verbessern.
	Was bedeuten "Best Practices" f\{\"{u}\}r Projektleiter und den Projekterfolg
	jedoch wirklich?
	
	Mit dieser Arbeit wurden zwei Ziele verfolgt. Das erste Ziel war das
	"Nebeneinander-Stellen" des theoretischen Projektmanagements (Literatur)
	und des Projektmanagementalltags (Interviews). Das zweite Ziel war
	die Ausarbeitung und Analyse von "Best Practices" und "Significant
	Events" im Rahmen der Experteninterviews. Die Daten wurden mittels
	halbstrukturierten Interviews mit erfahrenen Projektleitern und CIOs
	zu den Themen "Best Practices" und "Significant Events" erhoben.
	
	
	Die Interviewdaten wurden in folgende Richtungen ausgewertet: Welche
	Erfahrungen haben erfahrene Projektleiter und CIOs in ihrer Karrierelaufbahn
	gemacht? Wo "zwickt es" im t\{\"{a}\}glichen Projektgesch\{\"{a}\}ft?
	Was sind immer wiederkehrende Probleme und was sind die ganz pers\{\"{o}\}nlichen
	L\{\"{o}\}sungs- und Erfolgsstrategien der Entscheidungstr\{\"{a}\}ger
	f\{\"{u}\}r diese Probleme. Es wurden die allt\{\"{a}\}glichen Probleme,
	deren Ursachen und Auswirkungen aufzeigt, mit welchen Projektmanager
	im Rahmen eines Softwareprojektes in der Praxis regelm\{\"{a}\}\{\ss\}ig
	konfrontiert sind.
	
	
	Weiters wurden signifikante Ereignisse aus abgeschlossenen Projekten
	n\{\"{a}\}her betrachtet. Dabei wurden Antworten auf die Fragen "Wie
	kam es zu diesem Ereignis?", "Welche Personen (Rollen) spielten eine
	wesentliche Rolle?", "Wie h\{\"{a}\}tte man diese Situation verhindern
	k\{\"{o}\}nnen bzw. wie kann man gezielt auf diese Situation "hinarbeiten"?",
	"Was kann man dadurch allgemein f\{\"{u}\}r (zuk\{\"{u}\}nftige)

  abstract = {Arguably the most important development in the Canadian workplace
	in recent years has been the massive introduction of information
	and communications technologies (ICT). The impact of this development
	on a range of variables, including productivity and wages, are manifold,
	but are still poorly understood. Julie Turcotte and Lori Whewell
	Rennison of Finance Canada examine the effects of education, training
	and technology use on productivity and wages at the firm level. They
	make innovative use of Statistics Canada’s Workplace and Employee
	Survey, which allows the linking of the characteristics of workers
	in a firm to firm performance measures. They find that productivity
	is higher: the more intensively technology is used in the firm; the
	greater the proportion of university educated workers; the greater
	the participation of workers in formal training programs; the greater
	the proportion of workers who receive computer training; and the
	greater the firm’s export orientation. A key finding with important
	policy implications is that computer skills training can augment
	the qualifications of lower-skilled workers and consequently boost
	firm productivity.},

  journal = {Software Quality Journal},
  year = {1995},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {189--205},
  abstract = {Time to market is considered to be one of the most important quality
	attributes for an organization to retain its competitive edge. Soft
	factors are at least as important as technical issues in improving
	and controlling the time to market. Soft factors are used as a collective
	term for factors that are difficult to quantify exactly, i.e. non-technical
	aspects. Based on the identified importance of the soft factors,
	a method, incorporating the soft factors, has been developed to increase
	the predictability of time to market. The method consists of three
	main parts: model development, model usage and model maintenance.
	The proposed method is general, while the actual model is primarily
	useful for the organization for which data have been collected. The
	objective is two-fold: first to prevent a general method of incorporating
	soft factors into the prediction of the time to market, and secondly
	to identify a set of critical soft factors for the organization in
	which data have been collected. The model is based on data collection
	from 12 large software projects. Time to market, effort (manhours)
	and a grade for ten soft factors have been collected. The model is
	derived from a set of eight projects and it is evaluated using the
	remaining four projects. The method is shown to be superior to the
	prediction made without taking the soft factors into account. The
	need to maintain the model is stressed as the model will evolve with
	time through new experiences gained. The proposed method can be applied
	in practice to help software engineers and managers to plan and control
	time to market and soft factors in software projects.},

  abstract = {Project evaluation is essential to understand and assess the key aspects
	of a project that make it either a success or failure. The latter
	is influenced by a large number of factors, and many times it is
	hard to measure them objectively. This paper addresses this by introducing
	a new method for identifying and assessing key project characteristics,
	which are crucial for a project's success. The method consists of
	a number of well-defined steps, which are described in detail. The
	method is applied to two case studies from different application
	domains and continents. It is concluded that patterns are possible
	to detect from the data sets. Further, the analysis of the two data
	sets shows that the proposed method using subjective factors is useful,
	since it provides an increased understanding, insight and assessment
	of which project factors might affect project success.},
